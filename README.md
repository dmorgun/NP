This repo contains the following files:

* new.py - sample task we practised in class
* homework-1.py - homework #1

To run the tests in "quiet" reporting mode please execute the following command in terminal:

py.test -q homework-1.py

Note: you must have pytest and python installed on your computer. To check this, run:

python --version
py.test --version
